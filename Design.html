	<h1>Skiing Game Concept</h1>
	<p>Our idea is to create a simple cross-country skiing side-scrolling game.</p>
	<p>The background image layers would be:</p>
	<p><ul><li>A mountain and sky</li><li>trees or forest, perhaps a couple animals</li><li>The snow you are skiing on</li></ul></p>
	<p>The character would be a fairly generic skier, who must jump over any obstacles in the course. </p>
